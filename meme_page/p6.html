                Today we had a spokesperson from the government who wanted to use our data for several of their endeavours.
                It seems to be mostly for knowing more about the people they serve and them wanting to make sure that those who go against them will change their thinking.
                It feels like 1984 all over again, this is something bad. We're shaping people thoughts to obey and comply to a very authoritarian government.

              Getting out of this situation won't be easy, the company knows me, they could easily trace me or my loved ones. I'm not safe from hiding no matter hard I tried.
              I don't know if I can do this anymore. I really can't.
