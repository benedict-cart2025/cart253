            <p>
                Sometimes whenever I look back on this job, it astonishes me as to how much data runs through our systems.
                Terabytes or even more enormous amount of data flows through the network, most of them being those of the general public.
                Some of the things that we see are general things that humans search for such as social media, basic questions or where's a good vacation place to go to.
            </p>

            <p>
                Usually, all of this information would be then discarded when there's an excess amount to prevent our servers from going haywire.
                Although I wonder why as of late, why is the company wanting to collect more than what is needed?
                Instead of throwing them away, we are asked to preserve the private information of others, some of it being quite sensible in nature.
            </p>

            <p>
                All of this just doesn't seem to be same line of work I would've done back then, things don't feel right at all.
