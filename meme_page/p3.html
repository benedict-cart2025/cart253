            <p>
                A new device has rolled around the tech market, for the public at least. I heard from other people around the workplace, but our company was
                closely working with another tech mongol that created a bracelet that would track a person's health. Things like weight, heart rate, health, etc.
                Our database and the way how we manage data were greatly sought after by  this other company, which is why this collaboration happened.
                It feels weird to now store the different vitals of random people I guess. Kinda awkward and, feels like I'm just prying into their private world.
                With my concerns, I feel like doing something. I'll stay cautious with things right now, will build a plan to do something about his later.
