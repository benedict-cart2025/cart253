                This website holds a collection of journal logs from an unkonown programmer from the 7th to 14th of February.
                It is believed that this person is deeply entrenched in the network of Silicone Valley tech giants.
                We're not sure of their whereabouts as of October 2019, he seemd to have stopped being active after Valentine's Day.
                What you're about to read is an incredible insight on the inner workings of our modern digital world.
                As much as possible, we ask readers to keep this site on the down low, in order for it to not be taken down by those who
                do not wish for this info to spread.
