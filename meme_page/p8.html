           <p>
            After all of this crap that's happened over the pas few months, I can't do this anymore. Every person I had to deal with, I directed them to become products of a machine
            that don't care about them. Watching their lives spiraling out of control because of me, leading them to worse situations because of indifference? Fear of losing money? 
           </p>

            This engine that was built for good back in the day but now it seems like it's being used to exploit innocent folk and I'm nothing but a wretch for allowing it to happen.
            I'm quitting this place, but before I go I'll leave all this for people to see one day. Hope it can reach somebody so that people will know of how these companies ruin the lives
            of others from corporate greed.
