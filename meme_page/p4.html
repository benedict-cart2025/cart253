                This website holds a collection of journal logs from an unkonown programmer from the 7th to 14th of February.
                It is believed that this person is deeply entrenched in the network of Silicone Valley tech giants.
                We're not sure of their whereabouts as of October 2019, he seemd to have stopped being active after Valentine's Day.
