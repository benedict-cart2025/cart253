            The technology that we use keeps on changing, it's insane how something new or revolutionary seems to pop out every week or so.
            It's no big secret that AI has been in deep development for these past years. Looking at how things are going, AI could become
            a powerhouse of incredible feats.

            It was a particular day at work, we were asked to collaborate with an AI company that wanted to use our data to track the pacing of typing from users.
            They say that depending on the pacing, they can figure out the mental state of a person with their AI and then let advertisers use it for pushing their products.
            essentially using a computer to scan a person's mood without their knowledge to then bombard them with things they may need depending on their feelings.
            Seems extremely predatory to be very honest. It doesn't sit too right with me at all...
